# Stone Challenge
In this challenge, we should imagine a scenario where we have a list of items and a number of people (represented by their emails). Considering this scenario I had to create some functions
to map across between these two lists and return a value to each person's pay. One of the challenges was don't leave any value off, so if the division had some remain value one (or more members of the list) should pay
a little bit more.

### 🛠 Tools:

- JavaScript


### Testing

Two functions were created to generate a random number of emails and after you select a number of products the function will generate a list based on this number (with a random price and 
quantity)

Products list example 👇🏽

```
productList = [
    { product: "soap", price: 10, quantity: 2 },
    { product: "bottle", price: 30, quantity: 2 },
    { product: "cup", price: 20, quantity: 22 },
    { product: "popsicle", price: 10, quantity: 26 },
    { product: "candy", price: 190, quantity: 1 },
    { product: "water", price: 190, quantity: 1 },
];
```

Email list example 👇🏽

```
emailList = ["kyle@gmail.com", "sam@gmail.com", "ben@gmail.com"];
```

If you want to use the params generator here's an example 👇🏽 (you must set a number of emails, items and maximum price/ quantity of items)


```
generatingEmailList(num)
generatingProductList(items, price, quantity)
```
